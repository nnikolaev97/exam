### Let's begin

You knew about grain fields, forests, and sheep fields,
but there is more, you also can have hills.

Hill fields are acquired like any other fields,
buy it in the buy-field pile, and you can have hill or not.

Let's see.

 > Use the browser of _Martel_.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _grain_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _2_ a _field_ card of _grain_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _3_ no _field_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _event_ cards of _grain_.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _sheep_.  

### We need food to buy the field

Ok, we didn't have luck, but we can try to buy one.
Hill fields are fields, and they work like any other field.
Let Martel spend all their grain events and obtain a new field.

 > _Martel_ plays _2_ _event_ cards of _grain_ into the _event_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _grain_.
 > _Martel_ has at the square _2_ a _field_ card of _grain_.
 > _Martel_ has at the square _3_ no _field_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _5_ _food_ cards.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _event_ cards of _grain_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _sheep_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _forest_.

### And buy a field

We need luck, we can have any field card, lets cross fingers
and expect one hill field.

 > _Martel_ plays _4_ _food_ cards into the _buy-field_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > _Martel_ has at the square _3_ a _field_ card of _hill_.

Bingo. We have it.

### Hill also produce food

Hill produce food with the event called hill. Let's see
the Martel hand, may he has the event card?

 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _food_ cards.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _sheep_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _forest_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _hill_.

Bingo. Play that card:

 > _Martel_ plays an _event_ card of _hill_ into the _event_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _food_ cards.

The hill has produced food.

### The future

This is only the beginning, what else can we have in the hill?
