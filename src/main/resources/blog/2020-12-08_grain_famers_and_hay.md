# Grain, farmers and hay

### Life as a farmer

First look to the game.

 > Use the browser of _Martel_.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _1_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _event_ cards of _grain_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _grain_.

Martel is quite a farmer.

### Training the farmer

You know that you can play event cards to earn food from fields,
but you knew that you can convert event cards and food into
a worker?

So, do that, Martel plays both into the train pile.

 > _Martel_ plays an _event_ card of _grain_ into the _train_ pile.
 > _Martel_ plays a _food_ card into the _train_ pile.

And ready!

 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _2_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _worker_ card of _farmer_.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ cards of _grain_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _grain_.

You didn't won food, but you have a farmer...
But, what are farmers for?

### Collecting Hay

Farmers are one of a kind, 
they are good workers, but they only work when the field
produces food. When it happens, the worker, in addition to
food, also produces hay.

### The future of hay

Hay is funny, isn't it? Cows love it.
