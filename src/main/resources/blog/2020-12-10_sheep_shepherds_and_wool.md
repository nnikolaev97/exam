The Game continues expanding.
Now we have shepherds and wool!

## Farming the land

### A new game

Start as usual creating a one player game:

 > Click _New Game_ in the main header.  
 > Type _MysteryGame_ into the _new game name_.    
 > Select _Basic_ into the _game scenario_.  
 > Type _Martel_ into the _Player 1 name_.
 <!-- MOCK take _field_ as _sheep_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _field_ as _grain_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _event_ as _sheep_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _event_ as _sheep_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _event_ as _grain_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _event_ as _grain_ -->
 <!-- MOCK take _event_ as _grain_ -->
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

### Life as a shepherd

First look to the game.

 > Use the browser of _Martel_.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _1_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _event_ cards of _sheep_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _sheep_.

Martel is quite a shepherd.

### Training the shepherd

You can train shepherds combining 
a sheep event and food in the training pile.

 > _Martel_ plays an _event_ card of _sheep_ into the _train_ pile.
 > _Martel_ plays a _food_ card into the _train_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _2_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _worker_ card of _shepherd_.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ cards of _sheep_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _sheep_.

And like grain events in the training of farmers,
you do not earn any food for this event.

### Playing the shepherd

Shepherds love sheeps. 
Place them on sheep fields.

 > _Martel_ plays a _worker_ card of _shepherd_ into his square _1_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _3_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _worker_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ cards of _sheep_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _sheep_.
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _worker_ card of _shepherd_.

### Collecting Wool

Lumberjacks collect wool from sheeps.
Each time that you play a sheep event, they produce one of wool.

 > _Martel_ plays an _event_ card of _sheep_ into the _event_ pile.
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > The current player is _Martel_.  
 > The current round is _4_.
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _worker_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand no _event_ cards of _sheep_.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _material_ card of _wool_.  
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _field_ card of _sheep_.
 > _Martel_ has at the square _1_ a _worker_ card of _shepherd_.

### The future of wool

Hay is funny, isn't it? Termites love it.
