# Buying knights

Knights are cool, they are our favorite protectors and 
armies. We want them. We need them!

## Knights for food

### The initial gameplay

We start with a one player game:

 > Click _New Game_ in the main header.  
 > Type _FirstGame_ into the _new game name_.  
 > Select _Basic_ into the _game scenario_.  
 > Type _Martel_ into the _Player 1 name_.  
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 
### Playing for food

Just play few rounds and accumulate some food.
Imagine that your board ends with something like:

 > Use the browser of _Martel_.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 <!-- CHEAT _Martel_ picks _9_ _food_ cards at square _0_ -->  
 <!-- Click _Refresh_ in the main header. -->
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _10_ _food_ cards.   

### Buy knights

You can traing a knight by spending two of cards of food:

 > _Martel_ plays _2_ _food_ cards into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _8_ _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _knight_ card.

You can buy more than one knight at once:

 > _Martel_ plays _4_ _food_ cards into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _4_ _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _3_ _knight_ cards.

If you spend an even number of knights, it rounds down
the number of knights bought.

 > _Martel_ plays _3_ _food_ cards into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _4_ _knight_ cards.

And of course, if you spend 1 _food_ card you will get nothing:

 > _Martel_ plays _1_ _food_ card into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _4_ _knight_ cards.

### Knights limit

You have a limit of five knights in hand.
Let's recover a little bit of food. Play until you hav eplenty of food:
  
 <!-- CHEAT _Martel_ picks _8_ _food_ cards at square _0_ -->  
 <!-- Click _Refresh_ in the main header. -->
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _10_ _food_ cards.   

There is a limit of 5 knights in hand, if you try to buy more
you get only five and the rest of food is returned to the hand.

 > _Martel_ plays _4_ _food_ cards into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _8_ _food_ cards.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _5_ _knight_ cards.

And try again, and nothing happens:

 > _Martel_ plays _5_ _food_ cards into the _buy-knight_ pile.  
 > Click _Ready_ in the main header.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _8_ _food_ card.  
 > _Martel_ has in his hand _5_ _knight_ cards.
