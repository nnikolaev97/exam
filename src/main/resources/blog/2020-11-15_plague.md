# Plague!!!

Oh no! It was a disaster! A terrible plague 
is on our kingdom! But... who carried that plague?

There is a new event, that you can play! and summon!
It is the plague. Once you have a plague you can throw it
to any of your opponents. Isn't that amazing?

Play a little with your friend and let him to have
the pride of many and many knights.

### The Plague Event

The plague event is an event that you get like the 
rest of events. And in this example of game it 
turned out that Martel just got one.

 > _Martel_ has in his hand _1_ _event_ card of _plague_.

Muahahahaha!

### Playing the plague

Plague the plague to the pile of one enemy:

 > _Martel_ plays _1_ _event_ card of _plague_ into _Tyrell_ square _1_ pile.

And everything starts.

### Massive kills

The plague kills the 50% if the knights at any field.

 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ _6_ _knight_ cards.  
 > All players click _Ready_ and then _Refresh_ in the main header.    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ an _event_ card of _plague_ 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ _3_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _3_ no _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _4_ _1_ _knight_ cards.    

### The killing continues

Yes... the plague stays and continues killing the 50%, rounding up.

 > All players click _Ready_ and then _Refresh_ in the main header.    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ an _event_ card of _plague_ 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _3_ no _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _4_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  

### Until complete masacre

 > All players click _Ready_ and then _Refresh_ in the main header.    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ no _knight_ cards.

### The plague spreads

Once the plague kills all knights, then it spreads to the right!

 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ no _knight_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ an _event_ card of _plague_ 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _3_ no _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _4_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  

### And the killing continues

 > All players click _Ready_ and then _Refresh_ in the main header.    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 --> 
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ no _knight_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ no _knight_ cards.

### The lockdown

Only a lockdown is able to stop the plague.
One square without knights in the path of the plague ends with it.

 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ no _knight_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _1_ no _event_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ no _knight_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _2_ no _event_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _3_ no _knight_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _3_ no _event_ cards.
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _4_ _1_ _knight_ cards.  
 > _Tyrell_ has at the square _4_ no _event_ cards.

### The end?

It was a massive killing and almost all Tyrell troops
were decimated. But it was the end?

The plague is for now out of the game... but, could it return?
