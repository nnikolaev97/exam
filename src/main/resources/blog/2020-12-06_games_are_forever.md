# Games are forever

Once you create a game, you
can play to that game until 
you got tired, and one day
return and continue playing.

But because of it, you cannot
create two games with the same name,
once one game is used, it cannot
be used never again.

## No duplicated games

### Create the usual game

Start as usual creating a one player game:

 > Click _New Game_ in the main header.  
 > Type _MyGame_ into the _new game name_.    
 > Select _Mini_ into the _game scenario_.  
 > Type _Martel_ into the _Player 1 name_.
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

And now you have created the FirstGame.

### What if I repeat the Game name?

What if you want to create once again the same game?

 > Click _New Game_ in the main header.  
 > Type _MyGame_ into the _new game name_.    
 > Select _Mini_ into the _game scenario_.  
 > Type _Martel_ into the _Player 1 name_.
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->

It fails:

 > There is an alert message that says "The game 'MyGame' already exists".

Dismiss the error.
 
 > Dismiss the alert.
 > There is no alert message.

### What if other player uses the same Game name?

They can try...

 > Click _New Game_ in the main header.  
 > Type _MyGame_ into the _new game name_.    
 > Select _Mini_ into the _game scenario_.  
 > Type _Tyrell_ into the _Player 1 name_.
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->

But they fail...

 > There is an alert message that says "The game 'MyGame' already exists".

Once the game is created, no-one can create another game with the same name.
